"claude-ketchup": patch
---

- Fixed hook logs being written to the wrong directory, now correctly stored in .ketchup/logs
- Changed hook logging to append to a single file per hook instead of creating a new file each time
- Added clearer status messages during installation to distinguish between fresh installs and updates
