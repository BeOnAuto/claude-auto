This is a planning/infrastructure commit that added tasks to the ketchup plan but didn't make any user-facing changes. Since it's a `chore` commit that only modified the plan file, it doesn't represent actual feature delivery or bug fixes. This type of commit typically shouldn't appear in a user-facing changelog.

However, if you need a changelog entry:

- Added development plan for achieving 100% test coverage across the codebase
