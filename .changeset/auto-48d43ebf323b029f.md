"claude-auto": patch

Looking at the commit, this appears to be a test-only addition with no user-facing changes. For changelog purposes:

- Added test coverage for maximum line enforcement during live log tailing

However, if this is purely an internal test improvement with no user-facing behavioral changes, it might not warrant a changelog entry at all. Test-only commits typically don't appear in changelogs unless they're fixing a bug that was previously uncovered or documenting newly added behavior.

Would you like me to:
1. Omit this from the changelog (recommended for test-only commits)
2. Keep the single bullet point above
3. Review the actual code changes to see if there's a user-facing aspect I'm missing
