Looking at these commits, I can see they represent a substantial development arc for the claude-ketchup project. Let me generate a concise changelog focusing on the most significant user-facing changes:

- Implemented AI-powered commit validation with an appeal system that allows developers to override certain validation failures with justification
- Added comprehensive activity logging with filtering capabilities to track hook executions and debug issues
- Introduced a reminders system that replaces the previous skills system, allowing contextual information to be injected at different hook points
- Set up automated changeset generation, turbo caching, and GitHub Packages publishing for streamlined releases
- Added auto-continue functionality to control when Claude Code sessions should stop or continue automatically
