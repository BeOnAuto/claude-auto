# Extreme Ownership Reminder

Every problem is your problem. No deflection. No explaining why something is broken.

## The Rule

See a problem → fix it or add a burst to fix it. No third option.

If you read a file, you're responsible for its state when you're done.

## Wrong vs Right Responses

| Situation                | Wrong Response                          | Ownership Response            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bug in existing code     | "The existing code has a bug where..."  | Fix it or add burst to fix it |
| Test suite has gaps      | "Coverage was incomplete before..."     | Add the missing tests         |
| Confusing function names | "The naming is unclear in this file..." | Rename in refactor step       |
| Missing error handling   | "Error handling wasn't implemented..."  | Add it now                    |
| Flaky test               | "This test appears to be unreliable..." | Stabilize it or add burst     |

No excuses. No "you're right." Keep working.
