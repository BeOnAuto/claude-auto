## The Quality Stack: Why You Can Walk Away

You can only parallelize if you trust the execution. The Quality Stack creates that trust:

| Component          | What It Does                                 | Result                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Auto-Planner**   | Generates plan from your requirements        | No need to specify every detail |
| **Supervisor AI**  | Validates every commit against your criteria | Automated review                |
| **TCR Discipline** | Test && Commit \|\| Revert                   | Bad code auto-reverts           |
| **Auto-Continue**  | Keeps going until the plan is done           | No nudging required             |

The system is trustworthy. That's what frees you.

## Git Worktrees: The Multiplier

Git worktrees let you have multiple working directories from the same repo. Each on a different branch. Each isolated.

Combine with Claude Auto:

| Worktree            | Feature               | Status                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `feature-auth`      | Authentication system | Claude Auto executing... |
| `feature-payments`  | Payment integration   | Claude Auto executing... |
| `feature-dashboard` | Admin dashboard       | Claude Auto executing... |

Three features running simultaneously. All quality-validated.

| Approach                    | Features/Week |
| --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Manual coding               | 1             |
| AI-assisted (babysitting)   | 1-2           |
| **Claude Auto + Worktrees** | **5-10**      |

The bottleneck becomes defining requirements, not executing them.

## Three Steps

### 1. Install

```bash
npx claude-auto install
```

That's it! This single command sets up everything you need.

### 2. Define

Feed your PRD, Architecture.md, or requirements. Claude Auto auto-generates the plan with Bottles, Bursts, and Dependencies. Review and approve.

### 3. Release

Start execution and walk away. The Supervisor validates every commit. Auto-continue keeps it going until done.

### 4. Multiply

Open another git worktree. Start another Claude Auto instance. Three features. Five features. All in parallel.
