## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pnpm add claude-ketchup

# Verify
claude-ketchup status

# Check health
claude-ketchup doctor
```

## The Philosophy

Just like with real ketchup, you don't dump the whole bottle on your plate—you dispense it in controlled bursts.

```
BURST → COMMIT → BURST → COMMIT
```

The Ketchup Technique grew from frustration with AI over-execution. Ask for "Hello World" and get a nav bar, login system, and comment section. By enforcing small, reversible increments, the technique channels AI energy productively.
